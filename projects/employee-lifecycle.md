The Employee Lifecycle is a Flask application built for Catholic Charities that is meant to be the hub of any employee change for supervisors

### Project Background
When I was hired at Catholic Charities, one of my responsibilities was maintaining a Position Request workflow built in SharePoint 2013, with a SharePont Workflow, InfoPath form and a C# script that used ADP's API to get a list of supervisors and fill a MySQL db with those names which then populated a SharePoint list.

The workflow was used by hiring managers to request new or fill open positions across the agency. The hiring manager creates a position request in SharePoint to fill a newly vacant position, HR posts the position publicly, once a candidate is selected the position request is filled and notifications are sent to IT with on-boarding information and other stakeholders like facilities.

These requests would be open for weeks at a time. There were multiple points of weakness that would routinely frustrate both hiring managers and HR.

We were migrating to SharePoint Online and the thought of re-creating this with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow sounded like remaking something that would quickly become difficult to maintain, and a whole lot of work for a not necessarily improved app.
